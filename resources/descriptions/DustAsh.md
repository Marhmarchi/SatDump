# Dust/Ash RGB

The Dust/Ash RGB enhancement is intended to show and distinguish dust and ash, and also detect volcanic plumes.

### Appearance

### Intended usage

Dust and ash detection (volcanoes, Sahara blowoff etc.)

### Limitations

Daytime only.
Currently uncalibrated, color shades may vary.
It is not possible to determine either the height or the concentration of the dust cloud in the atmosphere from the Dust RGB alone.
It is not possible to deduce the visibility on the ground.
The typical magenta colour of dust in the atmosphere is not visible when clouds (high-level clouds) obscure the scene.
Thin or low-level dust clouds over the sea are difficult to detect. Solar imagery should be used in this case (eg, Natural Colour RGB).
Very thin (low concentration) dust clouds are not detected.
Low-level clouds are not well seen.
