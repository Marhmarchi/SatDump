This enhancement provides detection and monitoring of fires, assessment of fire intensity, detection of burnt areas during daytime.

### Appearance

### Intended usage

Fire detection and quantification 

### Limitations

Currently uncalibrated, color shades may vary.
Will easily detect high temperature locations like volcanoes, calderas, steel mill slag piles and similar, even if much smaller than the pixel size.
Fires are seen only in cloud-free areas.
Smoke is usually not detectable with this RGB (unless very thick with larger particles).
Burnt areas are not well seen.
Clouds are not seen at night.
Red component can saturate at a relatively low temperature, false alarms can appear as red pixels.
