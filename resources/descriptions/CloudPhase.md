# Cloud Phase RGB

The Cloud Phase RGB enhancement provides good quality microphysical information on cloud tops.

### Appearance

### Intended usage

Cloud analysis

### Limitations

Daytime only.
Currently uncalibrated, color shades may vary.
Phase detection of very thin clouds is still problematic in some cases. Cloud Type RGB may help to distinguish thin ice clouds from thin water clouds.
Does not contain temperature information, using it together with the Day Microphysics RGB or 10.8 Âµm IR might be useful.
